# Repository bootstrap and source provenance

Prepared locally on 2026-11-02 for the intended independent private repository `stefanavesand/game-shelf`, at the product owner's request. Local default branch: `main`. Remote creation is currently blocked: the configured GitHub integration returned `Resource not accessible by integration` for GraphQL createRepository and HTTP 403 for REST POST /user/repos. No remote repository, GitHub fork relationship or application deployment has been created. Once the owner creates the empty private repository, the prepared commits can be pushed without changing the existing pilot.

The initial PRD, docs, UI concept images, third-party notices and recorded license text were copied from the project history in [stefanavesand/OpenCatan](https://github.com/stefanavesand/OpenCatan/tree/5418f60) at source commit `5418f60`. These are planning/design and historical verification records. They are not a migration of the game implementation or proof of independently authored upstream code. Their source history remains available in that repository; it has not been rewritten or deleted.

Documents referring to `src/`, `pwa/`, `backend/`, scripts or historical test results describe the previous pilot unless explicitly updated with new-repository evidence. The initial bootstrap has no corresponding runtime files. Historical records retain their dates and scopes. Current work starts from the migration backlog; exact release/device/operations decisions and detailed design still need resolution.

The Calm Table direction was selected by the product owner. Both generated original concept images are retained as exploratory references, not approved shipping artwork or a playable prototype.

OpenCatan-derived runtime/types/geometry have not been copied into this initial repository. Their rights review remains LEG-01. The existing catan-ai MIT notice is preserved for provenance; no bot module is imported by this bootstrap. No blanket project license is assigned by retaining that notice.

The existing PWA URL, manifest identity, browser storage, anonymous principal credentials, Supabase data and Lovable deployment are unchanged. No secret/environment/live-game data was copied. Future moves require scoped extraction, preserved origin/attribution, test parity and explicit installed-client continuity checks.
